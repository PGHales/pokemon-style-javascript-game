# pokemon-style-javascript-game
This is just a fun project I worked on where I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA&t=4036s) from Chris Courses YouTube channel on creating a simple, pokemon-style game using Javascript. 

I used some assets found at [itch.io](https://cypor.itch.io/12x12-rpg-tileset) created by Cyporkador, and also the assets that came from the video mentioned above.
